# React Protected Rotues  (`react-protected-routes`)  

The third example, building on the [`react-auth-context-reload`](https://github.com/FredLackey/react-auth-context-reload) and [`react-jwt-callback`](https://github.com/FredLackey/react-jwt-callback) examples.  The first reloads appdata from local storage when revisiting the app.  The second handles a JWT callback from the authorization server.  This example adds protected routes to the application.  The protected routes are only accessible when the user is logged in.  If the user is not logged in, they are redirected to the login page.
